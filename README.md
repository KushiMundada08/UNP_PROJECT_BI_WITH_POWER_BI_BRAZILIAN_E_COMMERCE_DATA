# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_BRAZILIAN_E_COMMERCE_DATA

In partnership with UNP, I developed the Brazilian E-commerce Dashboard to deliver comprehensive insights into Brazil's online shopping landscape. This tool examines key metrics such as order volumes, preferred payment methods, and identifies leading product categories alongside top-performing vendors. It also monitors customer feedback, analyzes sentiment trends, and gauges user engagement to pinpoint drivers of customer satisfaction. Furthermore, the dashboard evaluates order patterns over time, assesses delivery efficiency, and maps regional sales distributions, offering a nuanced perspective on Brazil's e-commerce dynamics. Financial analyses encompass total revenue tracking, payment method trends, and the correlation between customer ratings and sales performance.
